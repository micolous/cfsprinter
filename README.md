# pagerprinter #

A program to print out the South Australian Country Fire Service pager feeds.  It is written in an extensible way, so other backends can be plugged in to it.

## Requirements ##

 * Python 2.6 or later.  Python 2.5 may work with the simplejson package installed.
 * On Windows, the Python win32all package.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
 * On Firefox, the cmdlnprint extension.  http://sites.google.com/site/torisugari/commandlineprint2

## Configuration ##

Configuration is done in pagerprinter.ini.  There is an example configuration
that is included.  You can start pagerprinter.py with a command line option of
what file you'd like to use settings from instead of pagerprinter.ini.

## Browser Support ##

Only Firefox / Iceweasel is supported at the moment.  You'll need the extension cmdlnprint installed.  You can get this from http://sites.google.com/site/torisugari/commandlineprint2

On Windows, you'll need to set the full path to Firefox in the "browser-exec" setting.

## Mapping Support ##

The following mapping backends are available:

 * google: Prints out a text-based map of directions from Google Maps AU.
 * googlescreen: Prints out the graphical, non-printer-friendly map from Google Maps AU.

## Plugins ##

There are two plugins included:

 * lpdprint: Prints the page as text on Linux and Mac OS X.  It uses the command-line lpr utility, and has been tested only using CUPS (not actual LPD).  This probably works on Windows too, if you're using Cygwin (or have lpr).
 * winprint: Prints the page as text on Windows.  This requires the win32all package.


## TODO ##

 * Fix google maps backend so it works with images.
 * Add other mapping backends.
 * Add other browser backends.
 * ???
 * Testing...
