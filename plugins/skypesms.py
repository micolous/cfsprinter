Skype documentation that isn't behind a wall, because Skype have some
funny ideas about the definition of "open source projects", that they
can demand you to sign up for a developer programme when you really
don't need to:
	<http://skype4py.sourceforge.net/doc/html/>

Library download:
	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/skype4py/files/>

Note that the API is entirely un-pythonic, so be careful.  It seems
like .NET coding conventions.

If you're finding yourself sending a lot of messages, sign up for a
proper SMS gateway.  It's cheaper and doesn't require Skype to be
running.
